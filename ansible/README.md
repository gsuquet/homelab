# Configuration with Ansible

## What is Ansible?
[Ansible](https://ansible.com/) is an open-source IT automation tool used to automate provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other IT processes. It allows you to define the desired state of your systems using simple, human-readable YAML files called playbooks.  

## Requirements
You can launch the Ansible playbooks either from the provided devcontainer or your local machine.  
The devcontainer has all the required tools and dependencies pre-installed.

To install the required tools on your machine, run the following commands:
```bash
make install
```
